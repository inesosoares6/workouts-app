# workouts-app

## Context
The idea of developing this app solved a specific issue: the assistant coach of my volleyball team used to give us warmup exercises with several papers in his hand. So, offering him an app to store the warmup exercises at the Secret Santa gift exchange would be a good idea. From that time, the app requirements increased and the app developed from just a place to store warmups to a complete gym assistant.

## Requirements
- Store gym workouts without internet usage;
- Generate random workouts;
- Share workout plans;
- Implement timer and Tabata timer;
- Record the user evolution in gym exercises and health (weight, body fat, and muscle);
- Define and store objectives;
- Show to the user some statistics of the workouts made.

## Development
Technologies:
- Frameworks: VueJS and Vuetify
- State Management: Pinia
- Database: localStorage

## Install the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)
```bash
npm run dev
```


### Build the app for production
```bash
npm run build
```
